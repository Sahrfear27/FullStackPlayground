"""
Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

An Object is an Instance of a class
Class: Person
Object : Mary

Note: All function in classes have it least 1 parameter called self. 
self is a reference to the current object. It is the same as this keyword in javascript
